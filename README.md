BAGELS! The Deductive Logic Game!           
By Wyatt Alexander:                      

A simple guessing game where the user has 10 tries to answer a 3 digit combination. They are given clues each time they answer. Game comes with an in-game desctipiton, and can be reran while active.

In game rules:

I am thinking of a 3-digit number with no repeated digits. Try to guess what it is. Here are some clues:               

When I say:     That means:    

Pico  One digit is correct, but in WRONG place
Fermi  One digit is correct, and in RIGHT place                   
Bagels  No digit is correct!                     

Example:          
If the secret number was 248 and your guess was 843, the clues would be Fermi Pico.

# Improvements or Possible Changes:

Edit program to ask player to play again after they used up all their tries, instead after each try.
