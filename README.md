           BAGELS! The Deductive Logic Game!           By Wyatt Alexander                      I am thinking of a {}-digit number with no repeated digits.                      Try to guess what it is. Here are some clues:               When I say:         That means:                                      Pico            One digit is correct, but in WRONG place                   Fermi           One digit is correct, and in RIGHT place                   Bagels          No digit is correct!                     Example:              if the secret number was 248 and your guess was 843, the clues would be Fermi Pico.
